                <p class="excerpt">Working on non-touchscreen devices often feels limiting, especially when trying to draw, design, or navigate with precision. Using a traditional mouse or trackpad can be frustrating for creative tasks or detailed edits. That’s where the <b>Pen Mouse</b> comes in — a sleek, <span class="more">handheld device that turns any normal screen into a touch-like experience. Acting like a stylus, the pen mouse allows users to point, click, and draw with natural hand movements, making interactions more intuitive. Unlike standard screens that require physical touch or expensive upgrades, a pen mouse uses motion sensors or wireless signals to simulate touch functionality, giving users the freedom to sketch, write, and navigate effortlessly. It bridges the gap between regular displays and touchscreens, offering an affordable and portable alternative for students, designers, and anyone seeking a more hands-on digital experience.</span>

This gap between virtual browsing and real-life experience inspired the creation of the <b>Smell Chip</b>. This innovative device allows users to <span class="more">smell fragrances, like perfumes or scented products, virtually by generating a small, controlled amount of the desired scent. The chip uses micro-capsule technology to release precise scent molecules, replicating the original fragrance in tiny quantities, just enough for a quick check. It transforms ordinary devices into scent testers, bridging the sensory gap in online shopping and digital experiences. With a smell chip, users can "try before they buy," making scent exploration as easy and immersive as scrolling through a product catalog.</span>

To solve this, I’m designing an <b>Automated Camera Switch Drone</b> that helps users focus on a <span class="more">single subject from multiple directions effortlessly. This drone carries multiple cameras pointing in different directions, automatically switching between them to always capture the best angle. Whether tracking a moving object, recording dynamic events, or creating immersive video content, the drone intelligently selects the optimal camera view, eliminating the need for manual controls. It offers a seamless, 360-degree perspective, making it perfect for filmmakers, vloggers, researchers, and anyone looking to capture every detail from all sides with minimal effort.</span>

                <p class="excerpt">Picture this: you finish a meal at a restaurant, and instead of waiting for the bill or handling cash, you simply scan a QR code, and everything is settled through an app. I’m designing an app that streamlines transactions between <span class="more">merchants and users, making payments seamless and hassle-free. Both users and merchants get a unique ID, and when they share it — via QR code, NFC, or a simple link — the merchant can instantly add the bill to the user’s account. The user then reviews and pays the amount directly in the app, with no need for physical bills, card swipes, or extra communication.<br><br>
                    For example, in a restaurant, the server can generate the bill and link it to the user's account in seconds. The user scans a code at their table, views the itemized bill, and pays — all within the app. No waiting, no confusion. This system reduces errors, speeds up service, and enhances the dining experience. We can further expand the app with features like split bills, tipping options, transaction history, and personalized offers, creating a complete digital ecosystem for easy and secure payments.</span>
